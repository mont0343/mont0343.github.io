        </h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Matthew, and I am 23 years old. I was born on April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2000 and have lived<br>
            here in Ottawa ever since. My main hobbies include playing video games, editing videos, playing<br>
            with my dog, and hanging out with my little sister. Previous to enrolling in this program I was<br>
            working a landscaping/snowplowing job for around 4-5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a returning <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> student looking towards a career change. I previously came to school<br>
            for the Computer Programming course, but withdrew about 1.5 years into the program due to<br>
            personal reasons.. but I am now matured and ready to delve deeper into something I have had<br>
            interest in my <em>entire childhood</em>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>One of my favourite quotes that I live by is..</strong>
