        <h2>About Me ⤵</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Matthew. I am 23 years old and was born on April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2000. I have lived<br>
            here in Ottawa ever since I was born. I am a returning <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> student looking towards a career<br>
            change.. I had previously come to school for the Computer Programming course, but ended<br>
            up withdrawing from the program due to personal reasons. But, I am now matured and ready<br>
            to delve deeper into something I have had interest in my <em>entire childhood</em>.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Previous to enrolling in this program I was working a landscaping/snowplowing<br>
            job for around 4-5 years. My main hobbies include playing video games, editing<br>
            videos, playing with my dog, and spending time with my little sister. 
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>My top two favourite hobbies are..</strong></p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Spending time with my little sister</li>
            <li>Video games</li>
        </ul>
